# High-Level Use Case Plan

## Problem Statement

Individual investors struggle to manage diversified portfolios across multiple assets and platforms due to market volatility, lack of expertise, and time constraints. Existing portfolio trackers offer static views but don’t actively optimize or adapt to user preferences and market conditions.

## Solution Overview
The Personal Financial Assistant is an AI agent that autonomously creates, manages, and rebalances a assets portfolio based on the user’s risk tolerance, investment goals, and market trends. It uses AI for predictive analytics and decision-making.

## High-Level Use Case
`User Input` 

The user provides their investment preferences (e.g., risk level: low, medium, high; goal: long-term growth, short-term gains; initial capital: $1,000).

`Portfolio Creation` 

The AI analyzes historical and real-time market data (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeFi tokens) to select a diversified portfolio aligned with user preferences.

`Asset Management` 

The agent connects to the user’s wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and executes trades via decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap or centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance.

`Monitoring & Rebalancing` 

The agent continuously monitors market conditions, portfolio performance, and external factors (e.g., news sentiment), rebalancing assets as needed (e.g., selling overperforming assets, buying undervalued ones).

`Reporting` 

The user receives periodic updates (e.g., weekly reports) on portfolio performance, including gains/losses and suggested actions.

### Phases

- `MVP Phase`

    The MVP focuses on core functionality to validate the concept with minimal complexity. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

    `MVP Scope`

    `Objective:` Build a basic AI agent that creates and monitors a crypto portfolio based on user risk preference.

    `Core Features:`
    - User inputs risk tolerance (low, medium, high) and initial investment amount.
    - AI suggests a portfolio from a predefined asset pool (e.g., BTC, ETH, USDT).
    - Tracks portfolio value using real-time market data.
    - Provides a simple dashboard with performance updates.

    `Limitations:` 
    
    No automated trading or rebalancing yet; manual user approval for trades.

    ### Further Phases

    #### Features to Add Later
    Once the MVP is validated, we can expand functionality to make the agent more autonomous, user-friendly, and feature-rich. Here’s a roadmap:

    `Phase 2: Automation & Trading `
    
    `Automated Trading:`

    Integrate with a DEX (e.g., Uniswap) via smart contracts to execute buy/sell orders.
    Use Web3.py to sign transactions via MetaMask.
    
    `Basic Rebalancing:`

    Add logic to rebalance portfolio monthly (e.g., if BTC exceeds 50% of high-risk portfolio, sell excess).
    
    `User Notifications:`

    Email or in-app alerts for significant market changes or portfolio updates.
    
    `Phase 3: Advanced AI & Personalization`
    
    `Machine Learning Model:`

    Replace rule-based logic with a trained ML model (e.g., LSTM for price prediction) using historical data.
    Train on Binance or CoinGecko data for better asset selection.
    
    `Custom Goals:`

    Allow users to set specific goals (e.g., “grow $1,000 to $1,500 in 6 months”).
    Adjust portfolio dynamically based on goal progress.
    
    `Sentiment Analysis:`

    Integrate X posts or news APIs (e.g., NewsAPI) to analyze market sentiment and adjust strategies.
    
    `Phase 4: Scalability & Security`
    
    `Multi-Chain Support:`

    Expand to Binance Smart Chain, Solana, etc., for broader asset options.
    
    `Enhanced Security:`

    Add multi-signature wallet support for safer fund management.
    Implement anomaly detection to flag suspicious wallet activities.
    
    `Scalable Hosting:`

    Deploy on AWS or Google Cloud with load balancing for more users.

    
    `DeFi Integration:`

    Stake assets in protocols like Aave or Compound for additional yield.
    
    `Social Features:`

    Allow users to share portfolio performance (anonymized) or follow top-performing strategies.
    
    `Mobile App:`

    Develop iOS/Android app for on-the-go management.

    `Tax Reporting:`
    
    Generate tax-compliant reports for crypto trades.
    
    `AI Advisor:`

    Chatbot interface for personalized advice (e.g., “Should I sell ETH now?”).
